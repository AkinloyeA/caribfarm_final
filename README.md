# Cloud Computing Capstone Project
Introducing our latest innovation: a webapp that lets users securely manage and perform transactions on the Kaleido Enterprise blockchain network. Our user-friendly platform developed in collaboration with Carib Farm, offers seamless login/signup, unique wallet addresses, and a clear view of available funds. It also enables users to borrow funds from the lender. Plus, with the ability to view recent transactions, users can stay up-to-date on all activities in the blockchain network. Built with Solidity, Node.js, HTML, and CSS, our app is the future of blockchain management. Watch our demo video to see how easy it is to revolutionize your blockchain experience.
